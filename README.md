# Credit-Risk-Analysis

## Project Objective:
The aim of this project is to develop a machine learning model using logistic regression to predict whether a loan applicant is a good borrower or a bad borrower. By analyzing historical loan data, the model assigns a probability score that reflects the likelihood of timely loan repayment. This score provides banks and financial institutions with actionable insights to make informed decisions on loan approvals.

## Problem Statement:
Banks face a significant challenge in assessing the creditworthiness of loan applicants, as lending to individuals with a high risk of default can lead to financial losses. The purpose of this project is to create a reliable predictive model that uses customer data to classify borrowers and assist in risk management.

## Approach:

### Data Understanding and Preprocessing:
Analyzed historical loan data containing features such as income, credit history, employment status, loan amount, and repayment behavior.
Handled missing values, normalized numerical features, and converted categorical features into numerical representations (using techniques like one-hot encoding).
### Model Development:
Chose logistic regression as the algorithm due to its simplicity, interpretability, and effectiveness for binary classification problems.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.

### Model Evaluation:
Used metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to measure the model's ability to classify borrowers correctly.
Generated a confusion matrix to analyze true positive, false positive, true negative, and false negative predictions.

### Insights:
Identified key features influencing the prediction, such as credit history and income level.
Fine-tuned the model to optimize prediction quality.

## Results:
The model provides a creditworthiness scoreCard (probability of being a good borrower), enabling banks to:
Reduce loan default rates.
Improve customer segmentation and risk assessment.

## Impact:
This project demonstrates how machine learning can streamline financial decision-making processes, reduce risks, and enhance profitability for banks. By leveraging data-driven approaches, the model aids in making fair and informed loan approval decisions, benefiting both lenders and borrowers.
